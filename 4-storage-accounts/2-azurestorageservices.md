# Azure Storage Services

- <strong>Azure Blob Storage:</strong> Allows unstructured data to be stored and accessed at a massive scale in block blobs.

Also supports Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for enterprise big data analytics solutions.

- <strong>Azure Files:</strong> Offers fully managed cloud file shares that you can access from anywhere via the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.

You can mount Azure file shares from cloud or on-premises deployments of Windows, Linux, and macOS.

- <strong>Azure Queue:</strong> Allows for asynchronous message queueing between application components.

- <strong>Azure Table:</strong> Allow you to store structured NoSQL data in the cloud, providing a key/attribute store with a schemaless design. Azure Table storage is now part of Azure Cosmos DB.
